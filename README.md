**isQED Website (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and NodeJS)**

*Silicon Valley Polytechnic Institute* - _07/2019 - 10/2019_

* Worked on a website (www.cqed.com) that provides electrical engineering training services.
* Built a feature that allows instructor to upload a CSV file with exam questions and answers.
* Built features to allow instructors to create, update, delete and publish certifications.
* Worked with the rest of the team to improve the code base, suggest features and do SCUM.

**Auction Website (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and NodeJS, Socket.IO)**

*Valley Medical Center Foundation* - _06/2019 - 08/2019_

* Worked with 4 members on non-profit auction website (www.elizabid.com) allowing users to bid on donated items.
* Added validation (front-end and back-end) to prevent users outbidding themselves, or bidding an unreasonable amount.
* Used Socket.io to display information correctly in real time bidding.
* Added a payment confirmation modal which allows the clerk to check out the winning packages, display new data to checkout list and save input to database without rendering the new page.

**Alarm Prediction Projects (Python, Django, Google API, ML, Java)**

When setting an alarm before an event in the morning, there are a lot of factors to take into account (traffic, event importance, event popularity). To make this easier, I developed a ML model and application that predicts what time the user should set their alarm to get ready for an event.

* **ML model**

    * Used the Google Maps API to collect over 8000 data points with features like the driving time, the event importance, reviews, price.
    * Used heuristics to include the amount of time the user will have to set their alarm before the event.
    * Developed and trained a DNN in tensorflow to predict the alarm time from the features.

* **Java GUI**

    * Led with a team of three to build GUI application which allows users to create/remove/modify the events and use the event info to predict the alarm time. The code follows Object Oriented Design.

* **UI Website**
    * https://github.com/wichersq/AlarmPredictionDjango
    * Led a team of three to develop a web user interface in Django which has the same features as Java GUI above. It also allows users to
import their personal Google calendar and uses the ML model to make predictions.
